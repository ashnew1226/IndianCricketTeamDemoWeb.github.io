                <h1>Indian Cricket Team</h1>
                <p>Some texThe India men's national cricket team, also known as Team India or the Men in Blue,[10]
                    represents India in men's international cricket. It is governed by the Board of Control for Cricket
                    in India (BCCI), and is a Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One Day
                    International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status.

                    Cricket was introduced to India by British sailors in the 18th century, and the first cricket club
                    was established in 1792. India's national cricket team played its first Test match on 25 June 1932
                    at Lord's, becoming the sixth team to be granted test cricket status. India had to wait until 1952,
                    almost twenty years, for its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket,
                    India didn't gain much success, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. The team,
                    however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players like Sunil Gavaskar, Gundappa
                    Viswanath, Kapil Dev, and the Indian spin quartet.

                    India has won five major ICC tournaments. The team has won the Cricket World Cup twice (1983 and
                    2011), the ICC T20 World Cup once (2007) and the ICC Champions Trophy twice (2002 and 2013) and have
                    also finished as runners-up in the Cricket World Cup once (2003), the T20 World Cup once (2014), and
                    the Champions Trophy twice (2000 and 2017). The team were also runners-up at the inaugural 2019–2021
                    ICC World Test Championship. It was the second team after West Indies to win the World Cup and the
                    first team to win the World Cup at home soil after winning the 2011 Cricket World Cup.t..</p>

                    <p> The 1983 Cricket World Cup (officially the Prudential Cup '83) was the 3rd edition of the
                        Cricket World Cup
                        tournament. It was held from 9 to 25 June 1983 in England and Wales and was won by India. Eight
                        countries
                        participated in the event. England, India, Pakistan and West Indies qualified for the
                        semi-finals. The
                        preliminary matches were played in two groups of four teams each, and each country played the
                        others in its
                        group twice. The top two teams in each group qualified for the semi-finals.

                        The matches consisted of 60 overs per innings and were played in traditional white clothing and
                        with red
                        balls. They were all played during the day.</p>
