                    <p>Cricket is the most popular sport in India by far,[4] and is played almost everywhere in the
                        country.[5]
                        The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the governing body of Indian cricket and
                        conduct
                        all
                        domestic tournaments and select the players for India national cricket team and India women's
                        national
                        cricket team.

                        Domestic competitions in India include the Ranji Trophy, the Duleep Trophy, the Vijay Hazare
                        Trophy,
                        the
                        Deodhar Trophy, the Irani Trophy and the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy. The Indian Premier League,
                        a
                        Twenty20 tournament where various city franchises compete in a style similar to club football,
                        is
                        one of
                        the biggest sporting leagues and the biggest cricketing league in the world.

                        International cricket in India does not follow a consistent pattern, unlike other cricketing
                        teams
                        such
                        as England, who tour other countries during the winter and play at home during the summer. The
                        Indian
                        cricket team is one of the most successful cricket teams in the world, having won 2 ICC World
                        Cups,
                        1
                        ICC World Twenty20, 2 ICC Champion's Trophies and finished runners up in the inaugural edition
                        of
                        the
                        ICC World Test Championship. The 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, was initially meant to be hosted
                        by
                        India. However, after the escalation of the COVID-19 Pandemic in India, the tournament was moved
                        by
                        the
                        ICC to the United Arab Emirates. The 2023 Cricket World Cup will be hosted by India.</p>

                <h1>Inidian Premier League (IPL)</h1>
                <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL), also officially known as TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons is a
                    professional men's Twenty20 cricket league, contested by ten teams based out of seven Indian cities
                    and
                    three Indian states.[1] [2] The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India
                    (BCCI)
                    in 2007. It is usually held between March and May of every year and has an exclusive window in the
                    ICC
                    Future Tours Programme.[3]

                    The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 was ranked sixth by average
                    attendance among all sports leagues.[4] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the
                    world to
                    be broadcast live on YouTube.[5][6] The brand value of the IPL in 2019 was ₹47,500 crore (US$6.2
                    billion), according to Duff & Phelps.[7] According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150
                    crore
                    (US$150 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy.[8] The 2020 IPL season set a massive viewership
                    record with 31.57 million average impressions and with an overall consumption increase of 23 per
                    cent
                    from the 2019 season.

                    There have been fifteen seasons of the IPL tournament. The current IPL title holder franchise is
                    Gujarat
                    Titans, winning the 2022 season.
