      <p>The Indian cricket team is an international cricket team representing India. It is governed by the Board of
        Control for Cricket in India, the cricket governing body in India. The Indian Cricket Team is currently the
        highest paid sports team in the world based on sponsorships.

        Debuting as test cricket team at Lord's, England on 25 June 1932, the Indian cricket team became the sixth Test
        playing team. For nearly fifty years, India was weaker than most of the other Test cricket teams, such as
        Australia and England, winning only 35 of the 196 matches it played during this period. The team gained strength
        near the end of the 50-year period with the emergence of players such as Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev and the
        Indian spin quartet. The Indian team has continued to be highly ranked since then in both Test cricket and
        One-day Internationals. The team won the Cricket World Cup in 1983 and was runners-up in 2003. The current team
        contains many of the world's leading players, including Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble, who hold
        numerous cricketing world records.. As of October 2006, the team is ranked fourth in the ICC Test Championship
        and in a tie for fourth place in the ICC ODI Championship</p>
